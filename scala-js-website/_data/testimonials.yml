- text: Coming from JS/Coffee/TypeScript, I think Scala.js is an absolute game changer for us. And as more and more
    Scala libraries get ported over to Scala.js, I believe this is just the start.

- text: The Scala.js experience was great! Thanks to the compiler and better IDE support, I was immensely more productive
    writing Scala for the browser than I am with plain JS and, say, Angular.

- text: Being able to leverage our existing build and test infrastructure for Scala.js has been a great productivity and
    reliability boost compared to bringing in an entirely different stack such as TypeScript. We have a number of
    computation libraries that have been ported to a shared module and can be used on both the front-end and the backend,
    which in and of themselves have made investment worthwhile.

    technical advantages and let us make a pleasingly responsive interface for our users.
