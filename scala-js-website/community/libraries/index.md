Great libraries make programming so much easier. With Scala.js you can use both Scala and JavaScript libraries in your code easily.

- [JavaScript facades](facades.html), letting you interact with Javascript libraries in a safe, strongly-typed manner
- [Scala libraries](libs.html), traditionally running on the JVM, now running on JS instead!
- [Testing Frameworks](testing.html), to make sure your code starts correct and stays correct
- [Project Skeletons](skeletons.html), to get started quickly.
