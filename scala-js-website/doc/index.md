This is the Scala.js documentation site. The bullets on the right link to various facets of the documentation: whether
you are coming from a [Javascript background](sjs_for_js/index.html), a [Scala background](scalajs_for_scaladevs.html)
or want to know more about the [exact semantics](semantics.html) of the language. Feel free to browse!

If you can't find what you want, or you want a longer more-structured introduction to Scala.js, check out the
[Tutorials](../tutorial/index.html) or watch a [presentation](../community/presentations.html) or two.
